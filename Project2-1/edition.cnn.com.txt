Julian Zelizer A devastating loss for Trump
Republican Senatorial candidate Roy Moore (R) stands off stage with his wife Kayla (2nd L) before addressing his supporters in Montgomery, Alabama, on December 12, 2017.
Democrat Doug Jones scored a victory Tuesday in a fiercely contested US Senate race in conservative Alabama, dealing a setback to US President Donald Trump, whose candidate could not overcome damaging sexual misconduct accusations. With 92 percent of precincts reporting, former prosecutor Jones secured 49.5 percent of the vote compared to Roy Moore&#39;s 48.8 percent, CNN and other networks reported.
