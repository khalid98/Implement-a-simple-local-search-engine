Google gets millions of searches every day. People are searching for products, services and solutions for their problem. That means people are searching for YOUR products and services!

There are lots of marketers who have heard about Google Adwords but aren’t sure if and how it will work for them. Being an enermously successful pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system, this works for almost any type of business.

If you are looking forward to learn from an expert about a platform that is scalable, measurable, flexible while being faster an easier than SEO – you are at the right place.

In the first two sections of the course, I am going to give you a warm welcome, explain the basic but key elements of Google Adwords that you must know before starting your journey on this platform.

In the third section, we are going to talk about the first steps you need to take – and of course we will take action! We will set up your account, you will learn about several important terms, keyword types and my special keyword research tactics.

In the fourth section, we will create your first Google Adwords campaign like a professional marketer while you will learn about several important tricks where most newbies and your competitors usually fail.

In the other sections, we are going to talk about how you can get a perfect landing page, write killer Adwords ads that sell, setting up your payment and optimizing your account.

At the end of the course, you will have access to two secret adwords hacks as a bonus.

By completing this course, you will learn step-by-step how to create your first successful campaign and optimize it afterwards – to get new customers and the most out of your marketing dollars! :)

Hi my Name is Daniel!

I´m a passionate Entrepreneur, Digital Marketer and Online Coach with hundreds of happy students.

At the Age of 18 I founded my first business - an "offline" Marketing Agency where we promote product from big brands in shopping malls and on events ...

But after 1 year I realised that the "internet world" offers a much bigger opportunity for building a business ...

In Late 2014 I launched the first regional Online Job Exchange for students - this platform was quite sucessful, but not very profitable. 

In 2015 established my first Digital Marketing Agency , where my team & I help clients to get more Leads and Sales over the Internet.

During this "agency years" my co-founder and I always wanted to create our own product - so after a few tries we started to build ventures in the Ecommerce sector and currently work on our SaaS Business for Onlinebusinesses.

In my courses I want to share my knowledge and my experience from my different ventures and client projects :)

Best Regards,

Daniel

Hi, I'm Sandor!

I am passionate entrepreneur and performance marketer with ten thousands happy students.

Let me tell you my story...

At the age of 16, I founded my first online business. After being a full-time CPA marketer for more than 5 years, I decided to shift gears and use my skills to build companies.

Ever since, I have been lucky enough to do what I love the most: entrepreneurship, travelling the world, pushing my comfort zone and discovering things that I couldn't learn in the classroom.

One year ago, I decided to take the next step and share my knowledge with those who are ready to start their own business. This decision brought me to Udemy, where I am able to combine my biggest talents: entrepreneurship, marketing and teaching.

My teaching philosophy on Udemy is simple: I am crafting trainings that I wish I had available to me when I started my first company.

My courses serve a very important goal: helping you to transform your life and becoming a successful entrepreneur and marketer.

I've seen the impact a solid business can have on someone's life. That's why I can only encourage you not to miss out on this opportunity.

As of today, I've sold more than 250,000 trainings, established multiple successful online businesses and coached hundreds of students.

So, that's my story. But now, I just want to ask you a simple question.

Do you want some help?

Do you want to establish your own business, become an entrepreneur or simply generate more revenue from your current business?

Great, because I am sure I am going to be able to help you. Feel free to check out my course portfolio and let's see if we can work together.

Best Regards,

Sandor Kiss

The content was good and I like that the videos were short. It made it nice and easy to digest and keep watching. I feel ready to tackle adword campaigns. The guy knows what he's talking about, however the pages were in German b/c he's from Austria. I'd like to have seen them in English, although the presentation is in English, for the most part. Also, the instructor says, "Yeah", a lot. Right in the middle of a sentence, rather than, "um". He also has the mouse arrow flying randomly around the screen and scrolls up and down while he's thinking about how to explain something to you. It gets annoying. But...the class was good and I DO appreciate what I learned.
